        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheHobbyCollab">The Hobby Collab</a> is an hobby focused youtube channel.
            Great streams, greater community! The hobby hangout voice channel on their discord is where it's at.</li>
        <li><a href="https://28-mag.com/">28 mag</a> is an most excellent miniature wargaming magazine. Be careful -
            each reading will inspire yet another project.</li>
        <li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/249299/f28-war-always-changes">F28</a> is an fast indie
            wargaming game
            system (with no website.) I've mainly used it for narrative Inq28 style games for which it excels but
            someday I'll play it 40k army scale mode.</li>
        <li><a href="https://howlcorp.com/">Dana Howl</a> produce fantastic hobby videos and her site contains useful
            reference materials for, e.g., contrasts paints.</li>

                href="https://earagnarok.github.io/list-view/?content=intro">EA Ragnarök</a> are fantastic project that
            keeps one of GW's best game, Epic Armageddon, alive. (I bet <a
                href="https://www.epicarmageddon.fr/">F-ERC</a> is great too but I
            don't know French.)</li>
